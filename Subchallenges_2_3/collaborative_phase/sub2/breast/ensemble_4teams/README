1. model_ensemble.r
This is the weighted average of top 4 teams; the weights are based on the leaderboard scores.


2. model_ensemble_lb.r
This is also the weighted average of top 4 teams based on leaderboard scores. However, the prediction of each team was first centered (minus the average and divided by standard deviation) to a reference before stacking. 

3.1 model_ensemble_cv.r
This is the weighted average of top 4 teams based on the 5-fold cross validation during the community phase. Each team performed 5-fold cross validation only using the training data and the weights were based on the cv results.

3.2 model_ensemble_cv.r
This is the weighted average of top 4 teams based on the 5-fold cross validation during the community phase. Instead of using a global weight for all genes, we calculated the weight for each gene.
